								On July 27, 2021, after watching the Chinese animated film <i>White Snake 2</i>, Zheng Chunyu posted a Weibo
								immediately.
							</p>
							<p>
								“I’ve just finished watching <i>White Snake 2</i>... It’s even better than <i>White Snake 1</i>! Everyone
								please go and watch
								it!!!!” Zheng wrote on her Weibo.
							</p>
							<p>
								22 years old Zheng Chunyu used to be a fan of Japanese anime. In recent years, surprised by the quality of
								Chinese animation, Zheng soon became a fan of Chinese animated films. “My favourite Chinese animated film
								should be <i>White Snake 2</i>. I love the imagination and quality of the work. For me, White Snack 2 is by far
								the
								best film of Light Chaser Animation Studio.”
							</p>
							<p>
								Based in Beijing, the Light Chaser Animation Studios mentioned by Zheng is one of the highest-grossing animated
								film studios in China. It was founded in March 2013 by Gary Wang, the founder and former CEO of Tudou.com, a
								Chinese internet video website. Light Chaser Animation Studios has produced six animated feature films since
								2015, grossing of more than 1.6 billion Chinese Yuan in Chinese Cinema by 2021.

								The first three films of Light Chaser Animation Studios, <i>Little Door Gods</i> (2015), <i>Tea Pets</i> (2017)
								and <i>>Cats and Peachtopia</i>
								(2018), are mostly targeting children and families. The shift of Light Chaser came in its first collaboration
								with Warner Bros. Pictures. In 2019, Light Chaser and Warner Bros released <i>White Snake</i>, an animated film
								featuring a romance story between a snake spirit and a human. The story and characters were based on a Chinese
								traditional folktale, <i>Legend of the White Snake</i>. This film, targeting teenagers and young adults, bring
								the
								first huge box office success to the studio, grossing 468 million Chinese Yuan.
							</p>
							<p>
								Light Chaser then started to produce more animated films targeting young adults audiences, based on Chinese
								folktale and myths: <i>New Gods: Nezha Reborn</i> (2021), <i>White Snake 2</i> (2021), and the coming new film
								<i>New Gods: Yang Jian</i> in 2022.
							</p>
							<p>
								With the success of <i>White Snake</i>, the market had a high expectation of the performance of <i>White Snake
									2</i>.
								According to the online movie ticket selling platform Maoyan box office, <i>White Snake 2</i> was screened more
								than
								154 thousand times on its first day of release, taking up 41.4% of Chinese cinema screens on July 23. It became
								the highest first-day screening rate of a Chinese animated film in Chinese cinemas.
							</p>
							<p>
								The final box office of <i>White Snake 2</i> was 580 million Chinese Yuan, becoming the new best of Light
								Chaser
								Animation Studios. <i>White Snake 2</i> is not the first Chinese animated film that get people’s attention.
								Audiences
								like Zheng first started to realize the potential of Chinese animated films in 2015, with the release of <i>Monkey
									King: Hero is Back</i> (2015).
							</p>
							<p>
								Directed by Tian Xiaopeng, <i>Monkey King</i> created a new record for the box office of animated films in
								China, a
								total of 954 million Chinese Yuan. Before 2015, the top 10 grossing Chinese animated films are mostly targeting
								Children. The success of <i>Monkey King</i> showed the potential of different forms of animation, that would
								attract
								audiences of all ages. It was the highest-grossing animated film in China for one year. The record was
								surpassed by the 2016 films <i>Zootopia</i> and <i>Kung Fu Panda 3</i> made by the United States.
							</p>
							<P>
								The producer of <i>Monkey King</i>, Lu Wei, told reporters from the Economic Daily that the box office
								performance was
								way beyond their expectations. “The support from the audience makes us more confident about our film,” Lu Wei
								said, “Seeing the success of this film, the artist, the investors, and the audience will have more confidence
								in
								the Chinese animation industry.”
							</P>
							<p>
								The unexpected performance of <i>Monkey King</i> brings stated the emerges of more animated films project. In
								China,
								the film scripts that have not been put in the archival files of the China Film Administration shall not be
								shot into films, and the films that have not passed the examination shall not be issued, projected, imported or
								exported. All the films that passed the examination of the China Film Administration would be listed publicly
								on its official website. According to the data from China Film Administration, the number of new animated films
								that were allowed to be produced in 2015 and 2016 has a huge growth after the release of <i>Monkey King</i> on
								July
								10, 2015.

							<p>
								The next historical moment for Chinese animation was the exceptional box office success of <i>Ne Zha</i>
								(2019), a
								film by director Jiaozi. Grossing nearly 5 billion Chinese Yuan during its three-month-long screening, the box
								office of <i>Ne Zha</i> is about 5 times of <i>Monkey King</i>’s in 2015. Following the 5.7 billion Chinese
								yuan box
								office
								of <i>Wolf Warrior 2</i>, <i>Ne Zha</i> has been the second most grossing film in Chinese history for more than
								a
								year.

							</p>

							<p>
								Xinhua Daily commented on the success of <i>Ne Zha</i> as having “a great significance for the rising of
								Chinese
								animation, opening new possibilities for the whole Chinese film industry, which show an ambitious attempt to
								build a ‘Cinematic Universe’ in China.”
							</p>
							<p>
								The production company of <i>Ne Zha</i>, Horgos Coloroom Pictures, used to have a trailer for the next movie at
								the
								end of their films. The bonus scene of <i>Ne Zha</i> was a short trailer of the film <i>Jiang Ziya</i>, another
								fantasy
								animated film of Horgos Coloroom released in 2021. The two bonus scenes of <i>Jiang Ziya</i>, are the trailer
								of
								director Tian Xiaopeng’s new film <i>Deep Sea</i>, and an unrevealed film featuring another Chinese Mythical
								character
								Yang Jian. Ne Zha, Jiang Ziya and Yang Jian are all characters from <i>Investiture of the Gods</i>, a Chinese
								mythology novel from the 16th century. The similar background of these characters and the close relationship
								between these films remind the audience of the superhero movies from Marvel Universe, which also have strong
								connections within their films.
							</p>

							<p>
								“The Chinese audience - who has contributed a massive amount of box office to the Hollywood films - has been
								expecting a Chinese ‘Marvel Universe’ for a long time,” reported by Xinhua Daily, “<i>Ne Zha</i> and the coming
								film
								<i>Jiang Ziya</i>, all featuring Chinese mythology characters, are making it possible to imagine a future for
								‘Chinese
								Super Hero Universe’”.

						<h2>
							<strong class='color'> The rising of Chinese animated films</strong>
						</h2>
					</div>

					<div class='part2-text'>
						<p>
							“The rising of Chinese animation (國漫崛起)” is a term frequently being used by media and the public to describe the
							growth of the animation industry in China.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to the 2020 Chinese Animation Industry Report by iResearch, the meaning of <i>Ne Zha</i>’s success are
							as
							important as the success of <i>The Lion King</i> in 1994, made by Walt Disney Animation Studios from the United
							States,
							and <i>Spirited Away</i> in 2001, produced by Studio Ghibli from Japan. These three films both became the
							highest-grossing animated films of their country. However, both Lion King and <i>Spirited Away</i> has great
							performance
							across the globe, having a higher box office overseas; while <i>Ne Zha</i>’s success only happened in the
							Chinese
							market.
						</p>
						<p>
							“The global success of <i>The Lion King</i> show the strong competitiveness and the internationally-accepted
							value of
							Disney,” the report said, “Chinese animated films haven’t got the international influence, and this is also a
							shortcoming of Chinese animation.”
						</p>
						<br>
						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8109191">
							<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
						</div>
						<br>
						<p>

							Japan and the United States has long been dominating the global animation industry, creating films with
							international influences. By December 2021, Walt Disney Animation Studios from the United States has a gross of
							more than 10 billion US Dollars globally. Produced by Disney, the animated film <i>Frozen II</i> has a worldwide
							box
							office of nearly 1.5 billion US dollars. By 2021, <i>Frozen II</i> is the highest-grossing animated film in
							history.
							The
							quality of Chinese animation was frequently been compare with the animation from Japan and the United State.
						</p>
						<p>
							iReseach concluded four problems exist in Chinese animation.
						</p>
						<p>
							First, the market for animation in China is still undeveloped. Compared to Japan, Korea or western countries,
							where a powerful and complete animation industry has been built, to produce an animation in Chinese still needs
							to go through a series of challenges.
						</p>
						<p>
							Third, without a film rating system, there’s no space for adult targeting animation, for example, <i>Love Death
								+ Robots</i> from the United States, or <i>Paprika </i>from Japan.
						</p>
						<p>
							Last but not least, the storytelling technique of Chinese
							animation is not mature enough. Compared to live-action films, animation pays more attention to creativity and
							imagination; but a good story is still the thing that attracts the audience into the cinema. iReseach thinks the
							storytelling abilities of Western and Japanese animation is the key to their international success.
						</p>
						<p>
							“As an audience, I feel like I haven’t seen a Chinese animated film that is of high quality in all the aspects,”
							said Zheng Chunyu, “People are strict to Chinese animation because Japanese and American animated film has built
							a high standard for the industry.”
						</p>
						<p>
							When asked about her impression of Chinese animated films’ box office performance, Zheng does not feel
							confident.
							“I think the audience of Chinese animated films is the same group of people. Audiences that are not interested
							in animation would just never buy a ticket. Except for some outliners like <i>Ne Zha</i>, I don’t think making
							animation
							in China would earn that much.”
						</p>
						<p>

							Zheng’s judgment was both right and wrong. Although the animation market was long been dominant by imported
							animation, the “battle” between Chinese animated films and animation from other countries has begun two years
							before the success of <i>Monke King</i> in 2015.
						</p>
						<br>
						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8087188">
							<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
						</div>
						<br>
						<p>
							In 2013, the box office of Chinese animated films suppressed the animation from the United States for the first
							time, with the small success of Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Mythical Ark, grossing 124.85 million Chinese
							Yuan. In 2015, <i>Monkey King</i> brings up the overall box office of Chinese animation, suppressing the United
							States
							animation again. Finally, in 2019, <i>Ne Zha</i> brings by far the greatest performance of animated films in the
							Chinese market.
						</p>
						<p>
							Animation from other countries, including Japan and collaborated films of multiple countries, rarely suppress
							the box office performance of animated films by the United States and China. Despite the influence of the
							Covid-19
							pandemic, the box office of Chinese animated films has been taking dominance in Chinese cinema ever since 2019.
						</p>
						<p>
							The growth of Animated films is both the cause and the result of the growing film industry in China. The box
							office in Chinese cinema has been growing every year until the Covid 19 pandemic, when cinemas in Mainland China
							was closed for more than half a year in 2020. From the end of 2020 until now, the box office is slowly getting
							back on track. The domestic-made animated films, from 2015, starts to take more share of the animation film
							market in China.

						<br>
						<p>
							“With the quality of Chinese animation rising, the animated films from foreign countries might not be
							competitive
							in the Chinese market anymore,” said Jin Gang, a senior animation storyboard artist who has worked for several
							animated films. Jin Gang said he believes that Chinese animation is on its way to rising.

							According to the box office data from Maoyan, out of the 10 highest-grossing animated films in China, 6 were
							made by the United States. However, the sum of the 4 Chinese animated films is 8.2 billion Chinese Yuan,
							suppressing the 6.3 billion Chinese Yuan box office by the 6 United States films.
						</p>
						<br>

						<br>
						<p>
							The top 10 animated films from western countries, including Zootopia (2016) by Disney, Coco (2017) by Pixar, was
							not only popular in Chinese cinemas, but also performs well in the global market. The 10 highest-grossing
							Chinese animated films, except for the blockbusters like <i>Ne Zha</i> or <i>White Snake 2</i> that targets a
							wide range of
							audiences, there is also a big amount of box office share by the children-targeting animated films, the Boonie
							Bears series.
						</p>

						<p>In terms of box office, the <i>Bonnie Bears</i> is now the most popular animated film series in Chinese
							cinema.
							Originated from the TV series of the same name, <i>Bonnie Bears</i> has released seven films on every Chinese
							Spring
							Festival ever since 2014, except the pandemic lockdown in 2020.
						</p>
						<p>
							By 2021, the box office of the <i>Bonnie Bears</i> series is nearly 3.3 billion Chinese Yuan, suppressing all
							other
							films series in Chines animated films market, including the Detective Conan movie series from Japan, and the
							<i>Kung Fu Panda</i> series from the United States. Directed by Ding Liang and multiple other directors, <i>Bonnie
								Bears</i>
							features two bears from northeast China, Briar and Bramble, who try to stop a logger named Vick from destroying
							their forest home.
						</p>
						<p>
							Watching <i>Bonnie Bears</i> every year has become a habit for many Chinese families with young children. The
							audience
							“Babafung” commented under the <i>Bonnie Bears: The Wild Life</i> on Maoyan: “I strongly recommend this film. As
							a
							Chinese animated film, it has great quality, it’s also very educational. It’s a great time for the parents to
							put down their phones and spend time with their children. A great film to watch in the Spring Festival.” Another
							audience, “Kuangren”, said that <i>Bonnie Bears</i> has become the film that she and her family must go and
							watch every
							year.
						</p>
						<p>

							A group of animals having an adventure together seems to be a successful “formula” to the Children-targeting
							animated film. Could this formula apply to other animated films in China? what are the other common elements in
							Chinese Animated films?

						</p>
						<p>
							Data analysis was conducted on the titles of Chines animated films. From the 230 Chinese animated films
							released after 2011, the most mentioned characters in the films titles are “Dragon”, “King”, “Wolf” and “Bonnie
							Bears”. Having animal characters is a common practice of Children-targeting animated films. Before the Bonnie
							Bears, the Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf movie series, also adapted from TV animation, has released seven films
							from 2009 to 2015. Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf, featuring the story of a group of goats and a wolf who tried
							to eat them, is also an animal character comedy animation. The film series was the dominant animated film series
							made for children before <i>Bonnie Bears</i>.

							<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
						</div>
						<p>
							The adaptation of traditional Chinese stories is also worth notice. From 2011 to 2021, at least 9 films about
							Journey to the West has been produced, more specifically, about the Monkey King character. <i>Kuiba</i>, a
							series of 2d
							Chinese animated films, is also paying tribute to the Monkey King, with the main character’s monkey appearance.
							Ne Zha is another popular mythological character, appeared in three films.
						</p>
						<p>
							Comedy, fantasy and adventure are the three most common genres for animated films in China. According to the
							film information from Maoyan, In 230 Chinese animated films released after 2011, 149 films includes the genre
							“Adventure”, 122 films includes “Comedy”, and 74 includes “Fantasy”. The graph below shows all the genres
							included in the Chinese animated film, categorized and labelled by Maoyan. While Thriller, Horror, and Sports,
							can also be found in some imported animated films, Chinese animated films have fewer categories.
						</p>
						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/8087515">
							<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
						</div>

						<p>
							Jin Gang thinks the limitation in genres is a result of the expectation of the audiences. Most of the audiences
							today walks into the cinema for an animated film having an expectation for a simple and colourful movie, an
							exciting adventure of the protagonist, a comedy that amuses the whole family, or a fantasy story that takes them
							away from real life. So the safest choice for the production companies is to include these genres in their
							films.
						</p>
						<p>
							“We do have animations that go beyond these genres, for example, <i>Have a Nice Day</i> and <i>Dahufa</i>. But
							excluding
							comedy or fantasy would shrink of the number of the target audience, which means giving up a huge amount of box
							office.” Jin Gang told the reporter.

						<p>

							The two films mentioned by Jin Gang was the representation of adult-targeted Chinese Animated films. Have a Nice
							Day, directed by Liu Jian, is a Chinese dark comedy and crime animation released in 2018. The film was highly
							praised by the film festivals and awards. <i>Have a Nice Day</i> won the best-animated feature for the 54th
							Golden
							Horse Awards, premiered in the main competition for the Golden Bear at the 67th Berlin International Film
							Festival. However, <i>Have a Nice Day</i> only received around 2.6 million Chinese Yuan box office.
						</p>
						<p>
							Compare to <i>Have a Nice Day</i>, the film <i>Dahufa</i> in 2017 has a relatively good box office performance,
							grossing
							around 87 million Chinese Yuan. Different from <i>Have a Nice Day</i>, which has a realistic art style, <i>Dahufa</i>
							does not give up the element of comedy and fantasy, but it was promoted as a PG-13 film, for the violent content
							in the film. “Please - do not bring your children to this movie!!” written on one of the promotional posters of
							<i>Dahufa</i>.
						</p>
						<p>
							“Except for the <i>Bonnie Bears</i> series, I have to admit that the majority of the Chinese animated films
							targeting
							children do not have the greatest quality, in terms of story and technique,” said
							Jin Gang “However, if the film is good enough, it would be accepted by the audiences. Whether it’s made for
							children or adults, I believe the genre would not be a big issue.”

							Timing means a lot. The box office of the Chinese animated films is closely related to two important periods:
							the Chinese Spring Festival, and the Summer vacation - the time in China when children, parents, students flowed
							into cinemas. The year 2020 was an exception - the pandemic postponed the release of <i>Jiang Ziya</i> from the
							Spring
							Festival to the Oct 1 Chinese National Day.
						</p>
						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8087415">

						</div>
						<p>
							The Chinese new year - Spring Festival, is an important “battle filed” for domestic-made movies. Seven films
							were released on February 12 on 2021, the first day of the Chinese new year, including two Chinese animated
							films: <i>Boonie Bears: The Wild Life</i> and <i>New Gods: Nezha Reborn</i>. The seven films created a box
							office of 13
							billion Chinese Yuan. According to Xinhua News, the box office of 2021’s Spring Festival has broken multiple
							records, creating the highest-grossing domestic box office in one day, also becoming the highest Spring Festival
							box office in Chines history.

						</p>
						<p>
							“Animated films have a relatively stable group of audience: children, students, and young adults. School
							vacations and public vacations would bring a great amount of audience into the cinema, and films of high quality
							would also choose to release during these times.” said producer Yue.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, releasing a film during the competitive vacation period might not be appropriate for every animated
							film. According to Yue, the release date is usually determined by the production company and the distribution
							company.

						</p>
						<p>
							“Every film has a suitable date for its release. To become a blockbuster, a film not only has to be of good
							quality, but also has to be released in the cinema during the most crowded time, in order to maximize the box
							office,” Yue said, “However, to release an ordinary film during Spring Festivals or Summer Vacations could be
							risky - it might be overshadowed by the hot films and ignored by the audience. The exact same film might have a
							better performance during a less competitive time, for example, Christmas and the January 1 new year vacation.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Instead of the Flim rating system, a movie examination system is applied to Chinese cinema. According to Article
							24 of <i>Regulations on Administration of Movies</i>, adopted at the 50th executive meeting of the State Council
							on
							December 12, 2001, “Films which have not been examined and adopted by the movie examination institution of the
							administrative department for radio, film and television under the State Council, i.e. the movie examination
							institution, shall not be distributed, projected, imported or exported.”
						</p>
						<p>

							When questioned if censorship sets special limitations to the animated films in China, producer Yue Kaixin feels
							there is no alternate standard for animations. “Having no film rating system, the censorship of all the films in
							China is a solid bottom line. There is no difference whether you are making an animation or live-action film in
							China.” Said Yue.

						</p>
						<p>
							Jin Gang, however, thinks censorship barely affects the creation of animated films in China. “The content that
							needs to be censored in China, for example, obscene, violence, or controversial topics, are not the core of most
							animations.” Said Jin Gang, “For me, I don’t think censorship would affect the animation industry. As the
							creator of Chinese animation, we should not take censorship as an excuse for not making good animated films.”

						<h2>
							<strong class='color'>Future and Possibilities of Chinese Animated films</strong>
						</h2>
					</div>
					<br><br><br>

					<div class='part5-text'>
						<p>
							The 2020 pandemic has brought a huge impact on the film industry. Different from live-action films, animated are
							made mostly in the studios rather than shooting onsite. It is also a common practice for animation companies
							from different places to work together remotely. Although the production was not greatly affected, the Chinese
							animated films are still risks during the pandemic.
						</p>
						<p>
							“The pandemic equally impacted the whole film industry. However, animated films usually have longer production
							times and a higher budget. When the pandemic outbreak happens, the number of people allowed in cinema will be
							restricted, affecting the box office performance,” said Yue, “The risk would affect the production of new
							animation projects.”

						</p>
						<p>
							The graph below shows the relationship between box office and audience rating on Maoyan of all Chinese animation
							films released after 2011. In the past ten years, only 36 Chinese animated films has a box office of over 100
							million Chinese Yuan. The majority - 204 films, have a box office under 100 million.
						</p>
						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/8088080">
							<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
						</div>
						<p>
							Overall, higher rates are applied to the top-grossing animated films, but there are also films that were
							favoured by the audience while having ideal box office. For example, <i>Kuiba</i>, a three series animated film,
							having
							a high rating for all three films, 8.7 for <i>Kuiba I</i>, 8.8 for <i>Kuiba II</i> and 9.4 for <i>Kuiba III</i>,
							only had 63 million
							Chinese Yuan box office for three films. The production company Vasoon Animation, had to announce the release of
							Kuiba IV will be postponed indefinitely.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Animation Industry Report of iResearch predicted the growth of non-children targeted Chinese animation in
							the future. From the audience side, many young people born after the 1990s have the habit of watching animation;
							From the industry side, the number of animation companies that are able to produce works with high standards is
							growing. In recent years, a series of high-quality animations targeting teenagers and young adults have received
							many positive commons. These phenomenons indicate that Chinese animation companies are able to produce more
							non-children target animation in the future. The supply and demand for animation that targets young audiences
							are gradually growing.

						</p>
						<p>
							iResearch also pointed out a major problem that exists in the animation industry: the shortage of talent.
						</p>
						<p>
							The industry needs more experienced animation directors and scriptwriters, to create animation with concrete
							stories, according to the report from iResearch. Also, companies and schools should learn from the industry in
							the United States and Japan, provide better training to the animation students. Lastly, the revenue of the
							animation industry employees are still too little compared to their hard works.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was only after the year 2000 that mainland Chinese has animation majors in universities. By December 2017
							around 22 thousand students are graduating from the animation major of Chinese universities. Around 350
							universities have animation major, but the quality of education could not satisfy the talent demand of the
							industry.
						</p>

						<p>
							David, an animation major student who graduated from Jilin Animation Institute, expressed his dissatisfaction
							with the animation education in China. “The animation education in China is seriously out of step with the
							animation industry. Many animation students needs to go through extra training outside of their school to be
							able to work for an animation company - most of the animation student around me from different school has the
							same feeling as me.” David told the reporter. To better prepare for their future career, David is now pursuing a
							graduate degree in animation at Savannah College of Art and Design in the United States, hoping to be able to
							participate in the production of Chinese animated films in the future.
						</p>
						<p>

							The animation fan Zheng Chunyu said she has high expectations for the future of Chinese animation. “I think
							visually, the quality of Chinese animation is already quite close to the Disney films,” said Zheng, “Apart from
							Chinese mythical characters, I am also expecting stories of more types, for example, hardcore Sci-fi story, or
							thrillers. I wish the animation industry in China could grow faster and bring more exciting works.

						</p>
						<p>
							“I expect more diversity in the art design of the animated films,” Said Tu, an animated film art designer,
							“Except for traditional Chinese elements, we could also include the culture element of other countries in the
							world.”
						</p>
						<p>
							When asked about the most expected animated film in the future, Yue said she looks forward to the new films of
							Jiaozi, the director of <i>Ne Zha</i>, and Tian Xiaopeng, the director of <i>Monkey King</i>. These two films
							have
							brought
							fundamental changes to the Chinese animated films industry, Yue said it will be excited to see their future
							works.
						</p>
						<p>
							Jin Gang and his colleagues already bought the ticket for I am What I am, a new animated film that will be
							released on December 17. He said the art design and the production quality looks great on its trailer.
						</p>
						<p>

							“I remember director Jiaozi once said in his interview: when we stop saying ‘The rising of Chinese animation’,
							that is the time when our animation industry has raised,” said Jing Gang, “Right now I could only say we are ‘on
							the way of rising’. More and more talents are joining this industry, people are having higher expectations of
							Chinese animation - therefore, I believe the day of the rise of Chinese animation would come.”
